* `Backtrace-node` now supports TypeScript. We care about your applications that using Backtrace-Node library so we prepared compatible API for you. If you still want to use modern API please use `BacktraceClient` instead.
* `Backtrace-node` options now support sampling and client rate limiting.
    - sampling allows you to drop random reports generated by your application depends on sampling value,
    - client rate limit allows you to set up client limit. By setting this value you will tell library how many reports per minute, client can send to Backtrace
* `Backtrace-node` send methods accept new paramtere - `fileAttachment`. If you pass array of strings `backtrace-node` will try to read each file from hard drive and add this as attachment to `backtraceReport`.
* `Backtrace-node` allows you to use `eventEmmiter` events! Now when you can use events like:  `'before-send'`, `'after-send'` and others!
* Modern Promise API is here! `Backtrace-node` allows you to use `async/await` syntax to send reports to Backtrace!
* `reportSync` and `reportAsync` methods now returns `BacktraceResult` object that allows you to understand what happend with report. If you have connection/configuration problems `BacktraceResult` allows you to learn what happend inside library!
* Backtrace prepare a lot sample application for you! If you want to learn how to use Backtrace in your nodejs application (no matter if you using JavaScript/TypeScript) please check examples directory!
