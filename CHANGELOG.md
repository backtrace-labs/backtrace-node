- `Backtrace-node` now supports TypeScript. We care about your applications that using Backtrace-Node library so we
  prepared compatible API for you. If you still want to use modern API please use `BacktraceClient` instead.
- `Backtrace-node` options now support sampling and client rate limiting.
  - sampling allows you to drop random reports generated by your application depends on sampling value,
  - client rate limit allows you to set up client limit. By setting this value you will tell library how many reports
    per minute, client can send to Backtrace
- `Backtrace-node` send methods accept new paramtere - `fileAttachment`. If you pass array of strings `backtrace-node`
  will try to read each file from hard drive and add this as attachment to `backtraceReport`.
- `Backtrace-node` allows you to use `eventEmmiter` events! Now when you can use events like: `'before-send'`,
  `'after-send'` and others!
- Modern Promise API is here! `Backtrace-node` allows you to use `async/await` syntax to send reports to Backtrace!
- `reportSync` and `reportAsync` methods now returns `BacktraceResult` object that allows you to understand what happend
  with report. If you have connection/configuration problems `BacktraceResult` allows you to learn what happend inside
  library!
- Backtrace prepare a lot sample application for you! If you want to learn how to use Backtrace in your nodejs
  application (no matter if you using JavaScript/TypeScript) please check examples directory!
